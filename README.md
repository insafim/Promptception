Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt design for  LMMs in Multiple‚ÄëChoice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15\% for certain prompts and models. This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected prompts. To address this, we introduce **Promptception**, a systematic framework for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types, spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight open‚Äësource models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks: MMStar, MMMU‚ÄëPro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with instruction semantics, while open‚Äësource models are steadier but struggle with nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust and fair model evaluation.

## üèÜ Highlights
1. **Comprehensive Prompt Sensitivity Analysis:** We present the most extensive study to date on the impact of prompt variations across diverse multimodal benchmarks and LMM architectures. To facilitate this study, we introduce Promptception, a systematic evaluation framework comprising of 61 prompt types, organized into 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each designed to probe specific aspects of prompt formulation in LMMs.
2. **Evaluation Across Models, Modalities, and Benchmarks:** We assess prompt sensitivity across a diverse set of model sizes and architectures, including both open-source and proprietary LMMs. Our analysis spans multiple modalities and benchmarks; MMStar (single image), MMMU-Pro (multi-image), and MVBench (video) and we further evaluate sensitivity across various question dimensions within these benchmarks to ensure a comprehensive understanding.
3. **Best Practices for Prompting:** We identify key trends in prompting and propose Prompting Principles for effective and consistent evaluation of LMMs.
